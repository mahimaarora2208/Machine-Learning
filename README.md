# Machine-Learning
Developed various supervised and unsupervised machine learning algorithms in MATLAB using C/C++ based on Andew Ng's course on Coursera on Machine Learning. Note that the data is already present in the file.
File structure is as follows:
1. ex1 (ignore the files not mentioned below) :

ex1.mlx - MATLAB Live Script that steps you through the exercise
ex1data1.txt - Dataset for linear regression with one variable
ex1data2.txt - Dataset for linear regression with multiple variables
submit.m - Submission script that sends your solutions to our servers
*warmUpExercise.m - Simple example function in MATLAB
*plotData.m - Function to display the dataset
*computeCost.m - Function to compute the cost of linear regression
*gradientDescent.m - Function to run gradient descent

2. ex2 (ignore the files not mentioned below) :

ex2.mlx - MATLAB Live Script that steps you through the exercise
ex2data1.txt - Training set for the first half of the exercise
ex2data2.txt - Training set for the second half of the exercise
submit.m - Submission script that sends your solutions to our servers
mapFeature.m - Function to generate polynomial features
plotDecisionBoundary.m - Function to plot classifier's decision boundary
*plotData.m - Function to plot 2D classification data
*sigmoid.m - Sigmoid function
*costFunction.m - Logistic regression cost function
*predict.m - Logistic regression prediction function
*costFunctionReg.m - Regularized logistic regression cost function
